# RFM-Analysis is used to understand and segment customers based on their buying behaviour. RFM stands for recency, frequency and monetory values, which are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty and value to business. 
Using RFM Analysis, a business can assess customemers:
recency(the date they made their last purchase)
frequency(how often they make purchase)
monetory value(the amount spent on purchases)
